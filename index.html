                            Bright Academy is one of the best schools in my district. The buildings of my school are very big and ground. The gate of the school is very high and broad. It is "L" shaped. There are 18 big classrooms, a hall, a peaceful library, one laboratory with all the necesiities for learning and two staffrooms. All the rooms are airy and well ventilated. <br />
                            We are like a family in our school. The teachers are very kind and coperative and they are kind of teacters who will always look for good solutions in tough times. Our headmaster is one of a kind. He is a kind and competent man. Our school is based on a God-fearing foundation. We will always respect one's religion and faith. I love my school so much because my school will always provide us with wisdom moments. I love the design of our uniform, its colors and many other things about it. There is a good arrangement of games and sports in my school. My school also takes part in various extra-curriculum activities.<br />
                            My school is known as one of the schools that perfom highly in academics. I love the atmosphere of my school because it is peaceful and suitable for studies. I love my school very much.

                            Among the many schools in Kasese District and the entire western region, Bright Academy Secondary School is the school where I have put my trust as a student who is focused. I speak this by experience because I started my senior one at this school but it was not in plan to complete my O'level at this school but I have come to know that for the betterment of my future, I must stay in Bright Academy for my O and A'level.<br />
                            This is because the school emphasises and encourages discipline. As everyone knows that discipline is the key to success, we are hoping to succeed as long as we are in this school. And indeed due to the total discipline, the school has never registered any indiscipline case like a strike as other schools do! ever since it started.<br />
                            Something better planned prior is something that lasts. I feel Bright Academy has built up the foundation of my future through academics, guidance and counselling in extension meetings the school often conducts.<br />
                            Another most wonderful thing is that the school has able and intelligent leaders who protect and respect students' rights. The administrators are good at responding to the students' requests quickly and in time. This encourages peace and harmony in the school-proper supervision and folloup on the science lessons and practical lessons. There is adequate learning materials in the school. Indeed Bright Academy is training tomorrow's leaders and responsible citizens of the country as the anthem of the school says.

                           Being honest, I have never regreted why I joined Bright Academy Secondary School since 2018, It had been my cry until when I appeared in it in 2019. From the good structures they have, a nice teaching staff they all attracted my attention. Students at school are taught to respect and be humble.<br />
                           Treasure in Education is our motto. When it comes to education, Bright Academy is far apart. As in school, the library is open 11/5, when it comes to the science laboratory, students consult, making more practicals purposely to prepare them for the exams. What inspires me most is the school debating club competetions that we hold every Wednesday and present on Fridays after chapel. All in all, we certainly know God. Muslims are allowed to go for prayers at the mosque and the Adventists also their day is respected then, the others we dress up smartly and then go for church service every Sunday morning.
